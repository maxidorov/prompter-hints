"A teleprompter\nalso known as an autocue, is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or script. Using a teleprompter is similar to using cue cards. The screen is in front of, and usually below, the lens of a professional video camera, and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the presenter using a sheet of clear glass or other beam splitter, so that they are read by looking directly at the lens position, but are not imaged by the lens. Light from the performer passes through the front side of the glass into the lens, while a shroud surrounding the lens and the back side of the glass prevents unwanted light from entering the lens. Mechanically this works in a very similar way to the \"Pepper's Ghost\" illusion from classic theatre: an image viewable from one angle but not another.\n\nBecause the speaker can look straight at the lens while reading the script, the teleprompter creates the illusion that the speaker has memorized the speech or is speaking spontaneously, looking directly into the camera lens. Notes or cue cards, on the other hand, require the presenter to look at them instead of at the lens, which leaves an impression of distraction.\n\nThe technology has continued to develop. From the first mechanical paper roll teleprompters used by television presenters and speakers at U.S. political conventions in 1952,[1] to dual glass teleprompters used by TV presenters and for U.S. conventions in 1964,[2] to the computer-based rolls of 1982 and the four-prompter system for U.S. conventions which added a large off-stage confidence monitor and inset lectern monitor in 1996,[3] to the replacement of glass teleprompters at U.K. political conferences by several large off-stage confidence monitors in 2006.[4]" = "提词器\n也称为自动提示，是一种显示设备，可通过语音或脚本的电子视觉文本提示人们说话。使用提词器类似于使用提示卡。屏幕在专业摄像机镜头的前面，通常在下面，屏幕上的文字通过一片透明玻璃或其他分束器反射到演示者的眼睛，以便被阅读者阅读。直视镜头位置，但不被镜头成像。表演者发出的光线通过玻璃正面进入镜头，而围绕镜头和玻璃背面的护罩可防止不需要的光线进入镜头。从机械上讲，这与经典戏剧中的“Pepper's Ghost”错觉非常相似：从一个角度可以看到的图像，但不能从另一个角度观看。\n\n因为演讲者在阅读剧本时可以直视镜头，提词器会产生演讲者已经记住演讲内容或自发说话的错觉，直接看着镜头。另一方面，笔记或提示卡要求演示者看它们而不是看镜头，这给人一种分心的印象。\n\n该技术不断发展。从 1952 年电视节目主持人和演讲者在美国政治大会上使用的第一台机械纸卷提词器，[1] 到电视节目主持人和 1964 年美国大会使用的双玻璃提词器，[2] 再到 1982 年和1996 年美国大会的四提示系统增加了一个大型的台下信任监视器和嵌入式讲台监视器，[3] 以在 2006 年用几个大型台下信任监视器替换英国政治会议上的玻璃提词器。 [4 ]";
